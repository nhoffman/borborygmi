Yet another installation of my personal notes for setting up a new (or
cleanly installed) MacOS computer. The process changes just a bit with
each new OS version. I will try really hard to reproduce the steps in
an order that make then easiest to execute.

This was not a re-installation (new laptop!), so no need to jump through the
hoops of downloading an installer, etc. Note that none of the steps below
require an Apple ID - I held off on signing in until the very end just to see if
it was possible.

I do copy some things over from my previous computer, but it's pretty
minimal. Here's the command to gather up what I need to transfer.

: tar -cf dotfiles.tar .gitconfig .gnupg .netrc .psqlrc .pypirc .ssh .aws .saml2aws .psqlrc .zprofile

It's also handy to know all of the projects I'm working on:

: cd ~/src
: for dname in */.git; do git -C $(dirname $dname) remote -v; done > remotes.txt

* system update

The first thing I did this time around was to perform a system software update
to get all of that waiting out of the way.

* Developer tools

Also takes a while. This can be done from the command line:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
xcode-select --install
#+END_SRC

* system settings

** turn off spelling autocorrect
: System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Text tab --> unselect "Correct spelling automatically" and others
** unmap Control + left,right

I use Control plus the left and right arrow keys to move between
windows in emacs and tmux, so I disable the defaults.

: System Preferences --> Keyboard --> Shortcuts --> uncheck mission control: move left/right a space

** Turn on FileVault

: System Preferences --> Security & privacy --> FileVault

I used a recovery key option rather than iCloud for my work machine, iCloud for personal

* homebrew

Still a one-liner, now bash rather than ruby:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew doctor
#+END_SRC

Homebrew is installed to =/opt/local= on an M1 Mac. This required updating my PATH configuration. I added the following to my login profile:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
if [[ -d /opt/homebrew ]]; then
    eval "$(/opt/homebrew/bin/brew shellenv)"
fi
#+END_SRC

The new location required a number of changes to various login steps configuring
homebrew-installed components.

** CLI applications

Many packages are installed later with additional elaboration or in as
dependencies for other applications; here are some more or less
standalone packages that I routinely install up front.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew install git && \
brew install wget && \
brew install autojump && \
brew install gcc && \
brew install graphviz && \
brew install latex2rtf && \
brew install mcfly && \
brew install pandoc && \
brew install pngpaste && \
brew install tmux && \
brew install tree && \
brew install fd && \
brew install xsv && \
brew install fzf && \
brew install saml2aws && \
brew install jq
#+END_SRC

** desktop applications

Homebrew installs desktop apps too! (the syntax has changed a bit)

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
for pkg in dropbox sizeup dash google-chrome mactex iterm2; do brew install --cask $pkg; done
#+END_SRC

Some of the above (eg, sizeup, dropbox, dash) require licenses and
credentials that must be installed interactively.

* iTerm2

Install using homebrew above. Update a few settings.

Preferences --> Profiles --> Keys and do these things:
- select "Left/right option key acts as": +Esc
- + --> Keyboard shortcut "OPT+<left arrow>": Send Escape sequence "b"
- + --> Keyboard shortcut "OPT+<right arrow>": Send Escape sequence "f"

(may have to delete or replace an existing mapping)

Default appearance:

- Preferences --> Profiles --> Colors --> Color Presets --> Light Background
- Preferences --> Profiles --> Text --> Change Font --> 14 point

Install shell integration:

: curl -L https://iterm2.com/shell_integration/install_shell_integration.sh | bash

- Install python runtime by selecting "Scripts" --> "Manage" --> "Install Python Runtime".
- Enable the Python API under "Preferences" --> "General" --> "Magic"

* zsh

zsh is the default shell on MacOS.

Install my dotfiles.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd ~
git clone git@bitbucket.org:nhoffman/dotfiles.git
~/dotfiles/mac/install.py
#+END_SRC

* python

Monterey apparently provides Python 3.8.9 as ==/usr/bin/python3== with no
==python== executable. I'm a little bit puzzled by this since my notes say that
Big Sur provided 3.9.5.

** pyvenv

My current method for managing python interpreters is to
use pyenv. See https://realpython.com/intro-to-pyenv/

#+begin_src sh
brew install zlib
brew install pyenv
brew install pyenv-virtualenv
#+end_src

Install pyenv-update plugin:

: git clone https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv-update.git $(pyenv root)/plugins/pyenv-update

added dotfiles/mac/zsh/pyenv.plugin.zsh

#+begin_src sh
if [[ -d "$HOME/.pyenv" ]]; then
    # echo "using pyenv"
    export PYENV_ROOT="$HOME/.pyenv"
    export PATH="$PYENV_ROOT/bin:$PATH"
    eval "$(pyenv init --path)"
fi
#+end_src

Install the most recent versions of 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10 and set 3.10 as the default.

#+begin_src sh
pyenv install $(pyenv install -l | grep '^  3.8' | tail -n1)
pyenv install $(pyenv install -l | grep '^  3.9' | tail -n1)
pyenv install $(pyenv install -l | grep '^  3.10' | tail -n1)
pyenv global $(pyenv install -l | grep '^  3.10' | tail -n1)
python3 -m pip install -U pip wheel
#+end_src

pyenv seems not to install a ==python== entrypoint. I'll see how it goes with
==python3== only.

** pipx

I'm trying out [[https://github.com/pypa/pipx][pipx]] for installing standalone python-language commands outside
of project-level virtual environments.

pipx recommends installation from homebrew, so that's what we'll go with:

#+begin_src shell
brew install pipx
#+end_src

The installation instructions include running ==pipx ensurepath==, but this appears not to be necessary if ==~/.local/bin== is already added to your PATH.

Install some globally useful packages:

#+begin_src shell
pipx install awscli
pipx install pgcli
#+end_src

* emacs

This required a bit of a change. For a long time I have been installing binaries
from http://emacsformacosx.com/. This project provides universal binaries, and
the command line executables are found within the Emacs.app application bundle.
Unfortunately I ran into some errors in which magit seemed to load precompiled
code for the wrong architecture - this seemed like too much effort to figure out
given that there are alternatives out there. I wound up using the [[https://github.com/d12frosted/homebrew-emacs-plus][Homebrew
emacs-plus]] project, which seems great so far.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew install libressl
brew install aspell
brew install gpg
brew tap d12frosted/emacs-plus
brew install emacs-plus
#+END_SRC

Check out my .emacs.d and run setup scripts.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:nhoffman/emacs-config.git .emacs.d
#+END_SRC

Run setup scripts:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
cd ~/.emacs.d
bin/python-setup.sh
#+END_SRC

The main inconvenience was having to adapt my startup script to juggle M1 Mac,
x86 Mac, and linux:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
if [[ $(uname) == 'Darwin' ]]; then
    if [[ $(uname -m) == 'arm64' ]]; then
        # assume we are using emacs-plus
        EMACS=/opt/homebrew/bin/emacs
        EMACS_BIN=/opt/homebrew/bin/emacsclient
    else
        EMACS=/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/Emacs
        EMACS_BIN=/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/MacOS/bin
    fi
    alias emacs="$EMACS"
    # provides emacsclient
    export PATH=$EMACS_BIN:$PATH
else
    EMACS=$(readlink -f emacs)
fi
#+END_SRC

* R

I had to give up on installing R with homebrew because it seemed to result in an
interpreter that always wanted to install packages from source. So I used the
arm64 binary from https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/

For next time: pretty sure ==brew install --cask r== is equivalent.

Some packages that I know I'll need:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
R --slave << EOF
packages <- c("lattice", "RSQLite", "latticeExtra", "argparse", "data.table", "tidyverse")
install.packages(packages, repos="http://cran.fhcrc.org/", dependencies=TRUE, clean=TRUE, Ncpus=4)
EOF
#+END_SRC

Wow, this takes a long time!

Also:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
brew install --cask rstudio
#+END_SRC

* postgresql

Install from https://postgresapp.com/downloads.html

This installs multiple versions of postgres. My zsh profiile includes the path
to the CLI for the latest version, eg:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
PATH="/Applications/Postgres.app/Contents/Versions/latest/bin:$PATH"
#+END_SRC
