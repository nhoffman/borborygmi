I came across this visualization[fn:1] of a very simple data set, and
it took me a few minutes to fully understand what makes it
so... suboptimal.

[[file:hold-the-pie/why_pie.png]]

- Ok, first of all, it's [[https://blogs.oracle.com/experience/entry/countdown_of_top_10_reasons_to_never_ever_use_a_pie_chart][a]] [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart][pie]] [[http://www.businessinsider.com/pie-charts-are-the-worst-2013-6][chart]].
- The labels are separated from the corresponding values.
- The grey scale color map doesn't distinguish well between categories.
- But here's the real problem: the covariates are combined into a flat list of categories!

Even a simple table tells the story much more clearly:

#+TBLNAME: counts
| colony count |  UTI | no UTI |
|--------------+------+--------|
| [0, 10K)     |  0.0 |    9.7 |
| [10K, 50K)   |  0.5 |   13.0 |
| [50K, 100K)  |  1.6 |   13.0 |
| [100K, Inf)  | 50.8 |   11.3 |

Now you can immediately see that most patients with UTI have a urine
culture with a high colony count, but there is a more or less uniform
distribution of colony counts among patients without UTI.

Let's play around with some visualizations that may do a better job
illustrating the relationship between colony counts and UTI.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports none :eval yes
1
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var counts=counts :exports none :eval yes
colnames(counts) <- c("colonies", "pos", "neg")
counts <- with(counts, {
  data.frame(colonies=ordered(rep(colonies, 2), levels=colonies),
             UTI=factor(rep(c('yes', 'no'), each=4)),
             percent=c(pos, neg)
             )})
counts
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:      colonies UTI percent
: 1    [0, 10K) yes     0.0
: 2  [10K, 50K) yes     0.5
: 3 [50K, 100K) yes     1.6
: 4 [100K, Inf) yes    50.8
: 5    [0, 10K)  no     9.7
: 6  [10K, 50K)  no    13.0
: 7 [50K, 100K)  no    13.0
: 8 [100K, Inf)  no    11.3

#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :file hold-the-pie/plot1.png
library(lattice)
library(latticeExtra)

barchart(percent ~ colonies,
         groups=UTI,
         data=counts,
         xlab='Colony count', ylab='Percent of patients',
         auto.key=list(corner=c(0, 1), title="UTI", reverse.rows=TRUE),
         origin=0,
         par.settings=theEconomist.theme()
         )
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:hold-the-pie/plot1.png]]

So this isn't too bad - we can easily compare the relative proportion
of cases with UTI in each of the bins. But this plot isn't so helpful
for conditioning one covariate on another, which, to me, is
fundamental to the purpose of the visualization.

With this in mind, I think that a stacked bar chart is a better choice.

This one shows the distribution of culture results among patients with
or without UTI.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :file hold-the-pie/plot2.png
barchart(percent ~ UTI,
         groups=colonies,
         data=counts,
         xlab='UTI', ylab='Percent of patients',
         auto.key=list(space='top',
             title='Colony count', reverse.rows=TRUE),
         stack=TRUE,
         origin=0,
         par.settings=theEconomist.theme()
         )
#+END_SRC

Or we can turn things around and look at the proportion of patients
with and without UTI within each range of colony counts.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :file hold-the-pie/plot3.png
barchart(percent ~ colonies,
         groups=UTI,
         data=counts,
         xlab='Colony count', ylab='Percent of patients',
         auto.key=list(corner=c(0, 1), title="UTI", reverse.rows=TRUE),
         stack=TRUE,
         origin=0,
         par.settings=theEconomist.theme()
         )
#+END_SRC

I like this last one the best - it best addresses to what extent urine
culture is useful diagnostically, by showing that if the colony count
is > 100K, there is about a 4:1 chance that the patient has a UTI, but
for lower values the likelihood is much lower. This is the point that
the authors of the study were trying to make - but with very little
help from the visualization above.
