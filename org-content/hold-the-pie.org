I came across this visualization of a very simple data set, and it took me a few minutes to figure out what makes it so... suboptimal.

[[file:hold-the-pie/why_pie.png]]

It's not just the pie-ness ([[https://blogs.oracle.com/experience/entry/countdown_of_top_10_reasons_to_never_ever_use_a_pie_chart][we]] [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pie_chart][all]] [[http://www.businessinsider.com/pie-charts-are-the-worst-2013-6][agree]] that it's best to avoid pie
charts, right?). There are a number of other problems here:

- Ok, first of all, it's a pie chart.
- The labels are separated from the corresponding values.
- The grey scale color map doesn't distinguish well between categories.
- But here's the real problem: the covariates are combined into a flat list of categories!

Even a simple table tells the story much more clearly:

#+TBLNAME: counts
| colony count |  UTI | no UTI |
|--------------+------+--------|
| [0, 10K)     |  0.0 |    9.7 |
| [10K, 50K)   |  0.5 |   13.0 |
| [50K, 100K)  |  1.6 |   13.0 |
| [100K, Inf)  | 50.8 |   11.3 |

Now you can immediately see that most patients with UTI have a urine
culture with a high colony count, but there is a more or less uniform
distribution of colony counts among patients without UTI.

Let's play around with some visualizations that may do a better job
illustrating the relationship between colony counts and UTI.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports none :eval yes
1
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC R :var counts=counts :colnames foo,bar,baz
colnames(counts) <- c("colonies", "pos", "neg")
counts <- with(counts, {
  data.frame(colonies=ordered(rep(colonies, 2), levels=colonies),
             UTI=factor(rep(c('yes', 'no'), each=4)),
             percent=c(pos, neg)
             )})
counts
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
:      colonies UTI percent
: 1    [0, 10K) yes     0.0
: 2  [10K, 50K) yes     0.5
: 3 [50K, 100K) yes     1.6
: 4 [100K, Inf) yes    50.8
: 5    [0, 10K)  no     9.7
: 6  [10K, 50K)  no    13.0
: 7 [50K, 100K)  no    13.0
: 8 [100K, Inf)  no    11.3

#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :file hold-the-pie/plot1.png
library(lattice)
library(latticeExtra)

barchart(percent ~ colonies,
         groups=UTI,
         data=counts,
         xlab='Colony count',
         ylab='Percent of patients',
         auto.key=list(corner=c(0, 1), title="UTI", reverse.rows=TRUE),
         origin=0,
         par.settings=theEconomist.theme()
         )
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

So this isn't too bad - we can easily compare the relative proportion
of cases with UTI in each of the bins of colony counts. But this plot
emphasizes the absolute prevalence of each combination of categories
(ie, UTI status + colony count), rather than the relative prevalence
of, for example, UTI status within each bin of colony counts, which is
what we really want to know when assessing the correlation between
covariates. I think that a stacked bar chart is more effective for
emphasizing the proportion of patients with and without UTI within
each range of colony counts:

#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :file hold-the-pie/plot2.png
barchart(percent ~ colonies,
         groups=UTI,
         data=counts,
         xlab='Colony count',
         ylab='Percent of patients',
         auto.key=list(corner=c(0, 1), title="UTI", reverse.rows=TRUE),
         stack=TRUE,
         origin=0,
         par.settings=theEconomist.theme()
         )
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:hold-the-pie/plot2.png]]

Or we can turn things around and look at the relative proportion of
each bin of colony counts among patients with or without UTI.

#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :file hold-the-pie/plot3.png
barchart(percent ~ UTI,
         groups=colonies,
         data=counts,
         xlab='UTI',
         ylab='Percent of patients',
         auto.key=list(space='top',
             title='Colony count', reverse.rows=TRUE),
         stack=TRUE,
         origin=0,
         par.settings=theEconomist.theme()
         )
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Both views are informative, but each addresses a different question.
