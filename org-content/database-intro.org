This post contains the content of a lecture prepared for Laboratory Medicine residents as part of a series on medical informatics.

* Objectives

- be aware that relational databases are a thing and can be described using some terms.
- get to know the different types of relations.
- see some examples.
- make a connection between the above and some useful habits (and harmful anti-patterns) for organizing laboratory and experimental data.

* Relational database terminology

- relational database :: a tabular database with defined "relations" among elements within and between tables.
- row :: contains a *tuple* or *record* representing a single item.
- column :: represents an *attribute* or *field* and corresponds to a labeled element of a record; all elements within a column are of the same data type.
- table :: a set of rows and columns.

#+CAPTION: Components of a table from a relational database. Source: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database][wikipedia]]

- primary key :: a field (or multiple fields in combination) that uniquely identify a row. Can either be *natural* (i.e., consisting of attributes that already exist in the table), or *surrogate* (i.e., a new attribute with no "real world" meaning created for the purpose).
- index ::

* Relations

** one to one
- describes the relationship between two or more elements in which each element uniquely identifies the other (likely to be true only in a specific context).
- represented by elements in the same row
- eg, name <--> mrn (but is this really true?)

#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
select mrn, name from patients;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| mrn     | name             |        dob | sex |
| U123456 | Roger Rabbit     | 1939-04-01 | M   |
| U654321 | Jessica Krupnick | 1924-10-27 | F   |

** one to many
- in the context of a database, is represented by a pair of tables, in which an element or row can be related to multiple rows in another table

#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
select name, mrn, accession
from patients
join results using(mrn)
group by accession
order by mrn;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| name             | mrn     | accession |
| Roger Rabbit     | U123456 | M00001    |
| Roger Rabbit     | U123456 | T00001    |
| Jessica Krupnick | U654321 | M00002    |
| Jessica Krupnick | U654321 | T00002    |

** many to many

- an entity in table A maps to more than one entity in table B, and vice-versa.
- a many-to-many relation between two tables is represented via a third *junction table* or *cross-reference table*.
- for example, each patient may see more than one physician, and each physician sees many patients.

#+NAME: show_patients
#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
select * from patients;
#+END_SRC

#+NAME: show_physicians
#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
select * from physicians;
#+END_SRC

#+NAME: show_physician_patient
#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
select * from physician_patient;
#+END_SRC

Now we can view all physician-patient relationships using a three-way join

#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
select name, doc_name from patients
join physician_patient using(mrn)
join physicians using(doc_id);
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| name             | doc_name        |
| Roger Rabbit     | Dr. Spock       |
| Roger Rabbit     | Dr. Strangelove |
| Jessica Krupnick | Dr. Spock       |
| Jessica Krupnick | Dr. Horrible    |

* More examples of relational database operations using SQL
** select
** join
** group and aggregate

* Other (non-relational) database types
** hierarchical

Hierarchical databases organize data in a tree-like structure. Data is represented as a graph of one-to-many (patent -> child) relations.

#+BEGIN_SRC dot :results output :exports results :file database-intro/hierarchical.png
digraph G {
"Hospital";
"Hospital" -> "Patient 1";
"Hospital" -> "Patient 2";
"Patient 1" -> "Accession 1";
"Patient 1" -> "Accession 2";
"Accession 1" -> "Order 1";
"Accession 1" -> "Order 2";
"Order 1" -> "Result 1";
"Order 1" -> "Result 2";
"Order 1" -> "Result 3";
"Accession 2" -> "Order 3";
"Order 3" -> "Result 4";
}
#+END_SRC

- hierarchical databases are arguably extremely well-suited for modeling healthcare data.
- can be used to efficiently represent data that would otherwise require many tables in a well-normalized relational database.
- depending on the structure of the hierarchy, certain queries can be extremely efficient: eg, all orders for Patient 1 can be found by traversing only the subtree containing data for that patient, which might represent only a tiny fraction of the entire database.
- other sorts of queries can be extremely inefficient: eg, finding all results of a certain type might require traversal of the entire tree!
- guess what: major healthcare applications such as the VA system (VistA), Sunquest FlexiLab, and many Epic products use a hierarchical database implemented using the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUMPS][MUMPS]] language.
