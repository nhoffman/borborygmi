* Objectives

- be aware that relational databases are a thing and can be described using some terms.
- get to know the different types of relations.
- see some examples of SQL in action.
- make a connection between the above and some useful habits (and harmful anti-patterns) for organizing laboratory and experimental data.

* Relational database terminology

- relational database :: a tabular database with defined "relations" (which can be described in terms of [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_algebra][relational algebra]]) among elements within and between tables.
- row :: contains a *tuple* or *record* representing a single item.
- column :: represents an *attribute* or *field* and corresponds to a labeled element of a record; all elements within a column are of the same data type.
- table :: a set of rows and columns.

#+CAPTION: Components of a table from a relational database. Source: [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database][wikipedia]]
[[file:database-intro/984px-Relational_database_terms.svg.png]]

- primary key :: a field (or multiple fields in combination) that uniquely identify a row. Can either be *natural* (i.e., consisting of attributes that already exist in the table), or *surrogate* (i.e., a new attribute with no "real world" meaning created for the purpose). An example of a combination of attributes serving as a primary key: name + DOB

#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite :exports results
select * from patients;
#+END_SRC

- index :: a data structure that improves the efficiency of data manipulation by reorganizing or clustering elements, typically as a tree.
- normalization :: when data is arranged to eliminate redundancy by dividing fields into separate tables, a database is said to be *[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database_normalization][normalized]]*. There is a tradeoff between normalization and complexity: a database may not be fully normalized to make queries simpler or more efficient (eg, by requiring fewer joins).

* Relations

For more details, see http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinality_(data_modeling)

** one to one

- describes the relationship between two or more elements in which each element uniquely identifies the other (likely to be true only in a specific context).
- represented by elements in the same row
- eg, name <--> mrn (but think about whether this is always true!)

Graphically:

#+BEGIN_SRC dot :results output :exports results :file database-intro/one_to_one.png
digraph G {
"Roger Rabbit" -> "MRN U123456" [dir="both"];
}
#+END_SRC

And in our database:

#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
select mrn, name from patients;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| mrn     | name             |        dob | sex |
| U123456 | Roger Rabbit     | 1939-04-01 | M   |
| U654321 | Jessica Krupnick | 1924-10-27 | F   |

** one to many
- in the context of a database, is represented by a pair of tables, in which an element or row can be related to multiple rows in another table

#+BEGIN_SRC dot :results output :exports results :file database-intro/one_to_many.png
digraph G {
"Roger Rabbit" -> "Accession M00001" [dir="both"];
"Roger Rabbit" -> "Accession T00001" [dir="both"];
}
#+END_SRC

In our database:

#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
select name, mrn, accession
from patients
join results using(mrn)
group by accession
order by mrn;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| name             | mrn     | accession |
| Roger Rabbit     | U123456 | M00001    |
| Roger Rabbit     | U123456 | T00001    |
| Jessica Krupnick | U654321 | M00002    |
| Jessica Krupnick | U654321 | T00002    |

** many to many

- an entity in table A maps to more than one entity in table B, and vice-versa.
- a many-to-many relation between two tables is represented via a third *junction table* or *cross-reference table*.
- for example, each patient may see more than one physician, and each physician sees many patients.

#+BEGIN_SRC dot :results output :exports results :file database-intro/many_to_many.png
digraph G {
"Roger Rabbit" -> "Dr. Spock" [dir="both"];
"Roger Rabbit" -> "Dr. Strangelove" [dir="both"];
"Jessica Krupnick" -> "Dr. Spock" [dir="both"];
"Jessica Krupnick" -> "Dr. Horrible" [dir="both"];
}
#+END_SRC

In our relational database, this relation requires three tables, one for each of patients and physicians:

#+NAME: show_patients
#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite :exports results
select * from patients;
#+END_SRC

#+NAME: show_physicians
#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite :exports results
select * from physicians;
#+END_SRC

And a junction table defining the many-to-many relationships:

#+NAME: show_physician_patient :exports results
#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
select * from physician_patient;
#+END_SRC

Now we can view all physician-patient relationships using a three-way join

#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
select *
from patients
join physician_patient using(mrn)
join physicians using(doc_id);
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| name             | doc_name        |
| Roger Rabbit     | Dr. Spock       |
| Roger Rabbit     | Dr. Strangelove |
| Jessica Krupnick | Dr. Spock       |
| Jessica Krupnick | Dr. Horrible    |

* Data types

Most databases and programming languages make a distinction between various *data types* (integers, real numbers, text, binary data, etc). Why is this important?

- Operations may be defined for some data types but not others (eg, division makes sense for real numbers but not text).
- Different data types require different amounts of space for storage. For example, in MySQL, a column containing an integer representation of true/false (eg, a *boolean*) requires only 1 byte per element, whereas the string "True" will typically occupy at least 4 bytes. This can become important when anticipating database requirements or managing large amounts of data.

In an SQL database, data types are defined along with the table schema:

#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite :results output
.schema results
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: CREATE TABLE results (
: 	mrn VARCHAR(7) NOT NULL,
: 	accession VARCHAR(4) NOT NULL,
: 	date DATE NOT NULL,
: 	battery_code VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL,
: 	test_code VARCHAR(3) NOT NULL,
: 	value FLOAT NOT NULL,
: 	flag VARCHAR(4)
: );

* SQL

SQL (originally SEQUEL for /Structured English Query Language/) is a programming language for managing relational databases. Although versions of SQL are defined in internationally-recognized standards, various dialects are used depending on the implementation. Many relational database programs are out there. Some examples of relational database products using SQL that you are likely to come across include:

- [[http://www.postgresql.org/][PostgreSQL]] (free/open source)
- [[http://www.sqlite.org/][SQLite]] (free/open source)
- [[http://www.mysql.com/][MySQL]] (free/open source)
- [[http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/server-cloud/products/sql-server/default.aspx][SQL Server]] (Microsoft, one of its flagship products)
- Various [[http://www.oracle.com][Oracle]] products (expensive and enterprise-y)

SQL was designed to be accessible to non-technical users!

Of these database engines, SQLite is probably the easiest to try out -
unlike the others, the database consists of a single, portable file
that can be accessed using either a command line interface or various
GUI's available for your favorite platform (SQLite is found [[http://www.sqlite.org/mostdeployed.html][pretty
much everywhere]]). For example, [[file:database-intro/results.db][here]] is the SQLite database used for
the examples in this post. If you're on a Mac, try this after
downloading to your Downloads folder:

- open Terminal.app (press CMD+SPACE and type Term...)
- type this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :eval no
cd ~/Downloads
sqlite3 results.db
#+END_SRC

You should see something like this:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
SQLite version 3.7.13 2012-07-17 17:46:21
Enter ".help" for instructions
Enter SQL statements terminated with a ";"
sqlite>
#+END_EXAMPLE

Go ahead and try out some of the examples above. You can also download
a GUI database browser ([[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite][Wikipedia]] has a list) and try out your queries
there.

* Some examples of relational database operations using SQL
** select

This query returns the entire table named =results=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
select * from results;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| mrn     | accession |       date | battery_code | test_code | value | flag |

| U123456 | T00001    | 2014-06-03 | CMP          | K         |   2.7 | L    |
| U654321 | M00002    | 2014-06-02 | CMP          | GLU       |  85.0 |      |
| U654321 | M00002    | 2014-06-02 | CMP          | K         |   4.1 |      |
| U654321 | T00002    | 2014-06-03 | BMP          | GLU       |  75.0 |      |

Use a =where= clause to specify a subset of rows.

#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
select * from results where test_code = 'GLU' order by date;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| mrn     | accession |       date | battery_code | test_code | value | flag |
| U123456 | M00001    | 2014-06-02 | BMP          | GLU       | 135.0 | H    |
| U654321 | M00002    | 2014-06-02 | CMP          | GLU       |  85.0 |      |
| U123456 | T00001    | 2014-06-03 | CMP          | GLU       |  90.0 |      |
| U654321 | T00002    | 2014-06-03 | BMP          | GLU       |  75.0 |      |

You can also specify a subset of columns.

#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
select mrn, date, value from results where test_code = 'GLU' order by date;
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| mrn     |       date | value |
| U123456 | 2014-06-02 | 135.0 |
| U654321 | 2014-06-02 |  85.0 |
| U123456 | 2014-06-03 |  90.0 |
| U654321 | 2014-06-03 |  75.0 |

** join

Relations between tables are specified using a =join= clause. Here's a two-way join between two tables, =patients= and =results=.

#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
select * from patients join results using(mrn);
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
| pkey | mrn     | name             |        dob | sex | accession |       date | battery_code | test_code | value | flag |

#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite
select patients.name, results.date, tests.test_name, results.value, results.flag
from results
join tests using(test_code)
join patients using(mrn)
where test_code = 'K';
#+END_SRC

* Hierarchical databases

Hierarchical databases organize data in a tree-like structure. Data is represented as a graph of one-to-many (patent -> child) relations.

#+CAPTION: An example of hierarchically-organized healthcare data
#+BEGIN_SRC dot :results output :exports results :file database-intro/hierarchical.png
digraph G {
"Hospital";
"Hospital" -> "Patient 1";
"Hospital" -> "Patient 2";
"Patient 1" -> "Accession 1";
"Patient 1" -> "Accession 2";
"Accession 1" -> "Order 1";
"Accession 1" -> "Order 2";
"Order 1" -> "Result 1";
"Order 1" -> "Result 2";
"Order 1" -> "Result 3";
"Accession 2" -> "Order 3";
"Order 3" -> "Result 4";
}
#+END_SRC

- hierarchical databases are arguably [[http://healthcaresecurity.wordpress.com/2010/10/12/why-are-hierarchical-databases-like-mumps-still-popular-in-healthcare/][extremely well-suited for modeling healthcare data]] extremely well-suited for modeling healthcare data.
- can be used to efficiently represent data that would otherwise require many tables in a well-normalized relational database.
- depending on the structure of the hierarchy, certain queries can be extremely efficient: eg, all orders for Patient 1 can be found by traversing only the subtree containing data for that patient, which might represent only a tiny fraction of the entire database.
- other sorts of queries can be extremely inefficient: eg, finding all results of a certain type might require traversal of the entire tree!
- guess what: major healthcare applications such as the VA system (VistA), Sunquest FlexiLab, and many Epic products use a hierarchical database implemented using the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUMPS][MUMPS]] language.

* Data management patterns and antipatterns

A basic understanding of database applications, relations, and data
types can help guide good practices for managing data. It makes
perfect sense to organize and collect (limited amounts of) data in a
spreadsheet, but it helps a lot to anticipate that you may want to
transfer that data into a database or use software for statistical
analysis or producing graphical output (such as R). This is a lot
easier if you keep a few rules in mind. Here are some tips.

** name fields sensibly

- When naming column headers, stick to lowercase letters and
  underscores only (numbers are ok after the first character).

| bad        | good        |
|------------+-------------|
| Patient #  | patient_id  |
| infection? | is_infected |

- If you have multiple tables, be careful to name fields consistently
  (don't use "DOB" in one place and "birth_date" in another).
- If possible, don't use [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Category:SQL_keywords][SQL keywords]] for column names.

** don't mix data types

Values in a column are expected to be the same data type. Some
databases will produce an error if you try to mix data types (eq,
putting a string in a column identified as an integer type). Others
may attempt to *coerce* data to the same type, producing unexpected
results. Even without an error, mixing data types greatly complicates
writing queries. For example, how can we find values greater than 10
in this table?

| run_id |     value |
|--------+-----------|
|      1 |         5 |
|      2 | cancelled |
|      3 |        11 |
|      4 |       < 2 |
|      5 |         4 |

In this case, it's better to create another column to contain the
non-numeric values.

| run_id | value | comment   |
|--------+-------+-----------|
|      1 |     5 |           |
|      2 |       | cancelled |
|      3 |    11 |           |
|      4 |       | < 2       |
|      5 |     4 |           |

** tall, not wide

Excel and EMR applications have made us accustomed to viewing data as
a square matrix.

| test_name | 2014-01-01 | 2014-01-02 | 2014-01-03 | 2014-01-04 |
|-----------+------------+------------+------------+------------|
| Sodium    |      135.0 |      137.0 |            |      150.0 |
| Potassium |            |        3.5 |        4.0 |        3.7 |

This is great for some purposes: it allows us to easily compare the
values of these two tests for this one patient over time. Or perhaps
the square is transposed:

|       date | Sodium | Potassium |
|------------+--------+-----------|
| 2014-01-01 |  135.0 |           |
| 2014-01-02 |  137.0 |       3.5 |
| 2014-01-03 |        |       4.0 |
| 2014-01-04 |  150.0 |       3.7 |

However, both of these are lousy formats for storing or manipulating
data:

- they are likely to be *sparse*, where many cells are missing data,
  and requiring as many columns as there are dates (first table) or
  tests (second table) in the entire data set.
- adding data for an addition test or patient is cumbersome.
- it is not possible to associate additional attributes with each value.

Here's an improved representation of the above data:

| test_name |       date | value | method | comment                |
|-----------+------------+-------+--------+------------------------|
| Sodium    | 2014-01-01 | 135.0 | serum  |                        |
| Sodium    | 2014-01-02 | 137.0 | ABG    |                        |
| Sodium    | 2014-01-04 | 150.0 | serum  | confirmed in duplicate |
| Potassium | 2014-01-02 |   3.5 | ABG    |                        |
| Potassium | 2014-01-03 |   4.0 | serum  |                        |
| Potassium | 2014-01-04 |   3.7 | serum  |                        |

This table has a fixed number of columns. Adding new data is as simple
as tacking rows onto the bottom. We can annotate values with arbitrary
attributes, such as methods or comments. It's even easy to aggregate
data from multiple patients by adding another column.

** be consistent

Composing queries will be easier if you are consistent in your representations of the data. I've frequently come across data like this:

| subject | antibiotics | growth | antibiotic   |
|---------+-------------+--------+--------------|
|       1 | Y           | +      | azith.       |
|       2 | N           | -      | azithromycin |
|       3 | yes         | +      | penicillin   |
|       4 | n           | +      | Penicillin   |

- within a column, pick a value and stick with it - it's awfully hard to write a query that accommodates multiple variants of the same term or concept.
- be consistent from column to column, as well. In the example above, we see both yes/no and +/- used as boolean values. How about this instead:

| subject | antibiotics | growth | antibiotic   |
|---------+-------------+--------+--------------|
|       1 | yes         | yes    | azithromycin |
|       2 | no          | no     | azithromycin |
|       3 | yes         | yes    | penicillin   |
|       4 | no          | yes    | penicillin   |

** use multiple tables (normalize the data)

Here's where understanding relations is useful. When I ask for data from the laboratory system, I typically get results back that look something like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC sqlite :exports results
select results.*, b.battery_name, t.test_name, t.ref_range from results
join tests t using(test_code)
join batteries b using(battery_code);
#+END_SRC

(The data isn't actually stored like this in the database, but when
the request for data includes all of the above fields, it winds up
denormalized in the process of fitting it into a single output table).

In this table, test_code uniquely identifies test_name and ref_range,
and battery_code uniquely identifies battery_name, so there's no need
to include the last three columns in our table of results (imagine
having millions of rows like this) - we can store these test and
battery attributes in separate tables and perform joins as necessary.
