#+TITLE: Creating a site with Pelican and org-mode
#+DATE: 2014-05-26
#+CATEGORY: org-mode
#+PROPERTY: TAGS org-mode, pelican, elisp

Never one to pass up the opportunity for yak-shaving, I thought I'd
finally try to settle on a publishing platform for various notes and
other content that I have scattered about on the web. The repository
is [[https://github.com/nhoffman/borborygmi][on GitHub.]]

I much prefer to generate content in org-mode, but I couldn't manage
to get org-publish to organize content in the way I wanted, or to be
easily compiled in batch mode. When I learned that the [[http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/index.html][Pelican]] static
site generator could import html and saw [[http://msnyder.info/posts/2013/12/introducing-pelicorg/][another effort]] to use the two
together, I thought I'd give it a shot.

* org-mode integration

At a basic level, integration with org-mode is pretty simple: Pelican
can import html content with page metadata provided in the
header. Since I already have some tools for exporting org-mode from
the command line (the project is named [[https://github.com/nhoffman/org-export][org-export]]), it was pretty easy
to write a utility for this purpose.

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output
org-export pelican -h
#+END_SRC

The utility renders the just body of the page (leaving all of the
styling, etc to Pelican) and provides page metadata in the header, for
example:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output eval: no
head ../content/getting-started.html
#+END_SRC

#+begin_example
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Creating a site with Pelican and org-mode</title>
        <meta name="authors" content="Noah Hoffman">
        <meta name="date" content="2014-05-26">
        <meta name="category" content="org-mode">
        <meta name="tags" content="org-mode, pelican, elisp">
        <meta name="save_as" content="getting-started.html">
        <meta name="url" content="getting-started.html">
    </head>
#+end_example

Specifying "save_as" and "url" was more convenient than trying to
guess how Pelican would name the page.

The org-mode source for each post is compiled to html and placed in
pelican's =content= directory, where it is subsequently added to the
site using =pelican content=. I liked that compiling each org-mode
file to html is performed separately from rendering the content with
Pelican: the former step is relatively slow, and a build tool can
easily be used to render only pages that have changed (I use [[http://www.scons.org/][scons]]).

There were a couple of tricky bits, though.

** Arranging content in subdirectories

First, I wanted to be able to create subdirectories containing data or
images for specific posts (as opposed to lumping them all together in
a single directory). Pelican doesn't seem to support this. So the
SConstruct file manages the creation of subdirectories in Pelican's
output directory and also copes page data and images there.

Then, when writing posts, you just need to remain aware of the
location of the data directory for a post relative to the org-mode
source; this relationship is preserved in the final output. Note that
the output of plotting operations should also be saved to the post's
subdirectory (eg, =plot1.png=).

Let's look at the organization of content and intermediate files for
this post. Here's the working directory when the org-mode source is
evaluated:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output
pwd
#+END_SRC

The org-mode source is here:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output :exports results
ls ../org-content/getting-started* | grep -Ev 'temp|^$'
#+END_SRC

Here is the intermediate html body for the post (note that these paths
are relative to the org-mode source):

: ../content/getting-started.html

And the final output:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output :exports results
ls ../output/getting-started* | grep -Ev 'temp|^$'
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: ../output/getting-started.html
: ../output/getting-started:
: Perameles_gunni.jpg
: plot1.png
: plot2.png

An additional complication is that the files for the index and
individual posts are at the top level of the output directory, but
other pages (in categories, tags, etc) are in subdirectories. Rather
than muck around with modifying linking behavior in Pelican, I just
fixed things up in the latter files with lxml in the script
=fix_urls.py=.

** Syntax highlighting

A lot of trial and error was required to export code blocks with
colorized syntax highlighting, and I still can't say I fully
understand why the final configuration seems to work when others I
tried didn't. But here are a few of the bits of magic that were required.

Requiring the =htmlize= package alone seems to be sufficient to
produce colorized syntax highlighting when exporting interactively
from within emacs. But an identical configuration did not result in
colorized output when exporting in batch mode using =org-export
pelican=. I finally came across advice someplace to use the
=color-theme= package along with some custom themes. Turns out that
after installing =color-theme= along with =color-theme-github=, simply
adding

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :eval no
(require 'color-theme-github)
#+END_SRC

was enough to produce colorized output. Go figure.

* Choosing a theme

There are plenty of choices over at [[https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes][the pelican-themes repository]], and
there were a number that seemed to work well (for the time being)
without any modification at all.

For convenience, I just added the themes repository as a git submodule.

Here are some I liked at first glance:

- bootstrap
- bootlex
- dev-random2 (though I'd have to do some translation)
- tuxlite_tbs
- tuxlite_zf (although I prefer more contrast between text and code)
- zurb-F5-basic

I finally settled on tuxlite_tbs (thanks, [[https://github.com/chanux][chanux]]), and made a local version, which I've modified minimally thus far.

* Hosting on github pages

Thanks to the magical [[https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import][ghp-import]], hosting on GitHub pages is as easy as

: ghp-import -p output
