#+TITLE: Creating a site with Pelican and org-mode

Never one to pass up the opportunity for yak-shaving, I thought I'd
finally try to settle on a publishing platform for various notes and
other content that I have scattered about on the web.

I much prefer to generate content in org-mode, but I just couldn't
manage to get org-publish to work as I wanted. When I learned that the
[[http://docs.getpelican.com/en/latest/index.html][Pelican]] static site generator could import html and saw [[http://msnyder.info/posts/2013/12/introducing-pelicorg/][another effort]]
to use the two together, I thought I'd give it a shot.

Pelican is pretty easy to get started with:

#+BEGIN_SRC python :eval no
virtualenv borborygmi-env
source borborygmi-env/bin/activate
pip install pelican ghp-import
pelican-quickstart
#+END_SRC

Which was enough to determine that it would be pretty smooth sailing.

* org-mode integration

Since I already have some tools for exporting org-mode from the
command line, it was pretty easy to write an exporter for this
purpose. Pelican can import html content with page metadata provided
in the header.

* Choosing a theme

There are plenty of choices over at [[https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes][the pelican-themes repository]], and
there were a number that seemed to work well (for the time being)
without any modification at all.

For convenience, I just added the themes repository as a git submodule.

Here are some I liked:

- bootstrap
- bootlex
- dev-random2 (though I'd have to do some translation)
- tuxlite_tbs
- tuxlite_zf (although I prefer more contrast between text and code)
- zurb-F5-basic

Settled on tuxlite_tbs (thanks, [[https://github.com/chanux][chanux]]).

* Hosting on github pages

Thanks to the magical [[https://github.com/davisp/ghp-import][ghp-import]], hosting on GitHub pages is as easy as

: ghp-import -p output

* Experiments

** Second-level headline

So let's try out some org-mode markup:

| here's | a    | table  |
|--------+------+--------|
| with   |      | values |
| in     | some | cells  |

#+BEGIN_SRC R :exports both :results output

plot(qnorm)
invisible(dev.off())
