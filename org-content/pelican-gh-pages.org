I've set up several Pelican sites on GitHub Pages and each time I seem
to run into way more trouble than seems necessary. Here are a few details that I seem to need to rediscover each time.

** Add themes as git submodules

For example, to use Flex:

#+begin_src sh
git submodule add https://github.com/alexandrevicenzi/Flex.git Flex
git commit -am "Added Flex submodule"
git push origin main
#+end_src

** Use nelsonjchen/gh-pages-pelican-action
